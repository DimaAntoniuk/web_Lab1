  <h2 class="paragraph_heading">1. It's not one big thing</h2>
  <img src="images/video.png" style="float:right" alt="[video]">
  <p class="paragraph">
    You may well ask: “How can I start using HTML5 if older browsers don’t
    support it?” But the question itself is misleading. HTML5 is not one big
    thing; it is a collection of individual features. So you can’t detect
    “HTML5 support,” because that doesn’t make any sense. But you can detect
    support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.<br><br>
    You may think of HTML as tags and angle brackets. That’s an important part
    of it, but it’s not the whole story. The HTML5 specification also defines
    how those angle brackets interact with JavaScript, through the Document
    Object Model (DOM). HTML5 doesn’t just define a
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
     tag; there is also a corresponding DOM API for video objects in the DOM.
    You can use this API to detect support for different video formats, play a
    video, pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded,
    and everything else you need to build a rich user experience around the
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
     tag itself.<br><br>
     <a href="#">Chapter 2</a> and <a href="#">Appendix A</a> will teach you
     how to properly detect support for each new HTML5 feature.
  </p>

  <h2 class="paragraph_heading">2. You don’t need to throw anything away</h2>
  <img src="images/forms.png" style="float:left" alt="[forms]">
  <p class="paragraph">
    Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that HTML 4 is the most successful
    markup format ever. HTML5 builds on that success. You don’t need to throw
    away your existing markup. You don’t need to relearn things you already know.
    If your web application worked yesterday in HTML 4, it will still work
    today in HTML5. Period.<br><br>
    Now, if you want to
    <em>improve</em>
    your web applications, you’ve come to the right
    place. Here’s a concrete example: HTML5 supports all the form controls from
    HTML 4, but it also includes new input controls. Some of these are
    long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more
    subtle. For example, the <code>email</code> input type looks just like a
    text box, but mobile browsers will customize their onscreen keyboard to
    make it easier to type
    <code>email</code> addresses. Older browsers that don’t support the
    <code>email</code> input type will treat it as a regular text field, and
    the form still works with no markup changes or scripting hacks. This means
    you can start improving your web forms
    <em>today</em>
    , even if some of your visitors are stuck on IE 6.
    <br><br>
    Read all the gory details about HTML5 forms in <a href="#">Chapter 9.</a>

  <h2 class="paragraph_heading">3. It’s easy to get started</h2>
  <img src="images/markup-with-arrow.png" alt="[markup_with_arrow]">
  <p class="paragraph">
    “Upgrading” to HTML5 can be as simple as changing your doctype. The doctype
    should already be on the first line of every HTML page. Previous versions
    of HTML defined a lot of doctypes, and choosing the right one could be
    tricky. In HTML5, there is only one doctype:
    <blockquote>
      <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
    </blockquote>
    Upgrading to the HTML5 doctype won’t break your existing markup, because
    <a href="#">obsolete elements</a> previously defined in HTML 4 will still render in
    HTML5. But it will allow you to use — and validate — new semantic elements
    like
    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.
    You’ll learn all about these new elements in <a href="#">Chapter 3.</a>
  </p>

  <h2 class="paragraph_heading">4. It already works</h2>
  <img src="images/rel-email.png" style="float:left" alt="[email]">
  <p class="paragraph">
    Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or
    build web applications that work offline, you’ll find that HTML5 is already
    well-supported. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers already
    support canvas (<a href="#">Chapter 4</a>), video
    (<a href="#">Chapter 5</a>), geolocation (<a href="#">Chapter 6</a>),
    local storage (<a href="#">Chapter 7</a>), and more. Google already
    supports microdata annotations (<a href="#">Chapter 10</a>). Even Microsoft
    — rarely known for blazing the trail of standards support — supports most
    HTML5 features in Internet Explorer 9.

  <p class="paragraph">
    Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser
    compatibility charts. But more importantly, each chapter includes a frank
    discussion of your options if you need to support older browsers. HTML5
    features like geolocation (<a href="#">Chapter 6</a>) and video
    (<a href="#">Chapter 5</a>) were first provided by browser plugins like
    Gears or Flash. Other features, like canvas (<a href="#">Chapter 4</a>),
    can be emulated entirely in JavaScript. This book will teach you how to
    target the native features of modern browsers, without leaving older
    browsers behind.

  <h2 class="paragraph_heading">5. It’s here to stay</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later
    founded the W3C to act as a steward of web standards, which the
    organization has done for more than 15 years. Here is what the W3C had to
    say about the future of web standards, in July 2009:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Today the Director announces that when the XHTML 2 Working Group
        charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not
        be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the HTML
        Working Group, W3C hopes to accelerate the progress of HTML5 and
        clarify W3C’s position regarding the future of HTML.
      </p>
